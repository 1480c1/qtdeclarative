    \title Qt Quick 2D Renderer

    \RENDERER is an alternative renderer for Qt Quick 2 that uses the Raster
    paint engine to render the contents of the scene graph instead of OpenGL.
    As a result of not using OpenGL to render the scene graph, some features
    and optimizations are no longer available. Most Qt Quick 2 applications
    will run without modification though any attempts to use unsupported
    features will be ignored. By using the \RENDERER it is now possible to run Qt
    Quick 2 applications on hardware and platforms that do not have OpenGL
    support.

    \RENDERER is a Qt module that contains a scene graph renderer plugin.

    To use \RENDERER add the following to your run environment:
    \badcode
    export QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext
    \endcode
