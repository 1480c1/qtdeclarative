This is a snapshot of the files: DateMath.h and DateMath.cpp
from a snapshot of JavaScriptCore from

        git://gitorious.org/qtwebkit/qtwebkit.git

The commit imported was from the

        javascriptcore-snapshot-27012011 branch/tag

and has the sha1 checksum

        3ab0f621048fbeb480b687a28ed31d92d8506150

The two files were then modified slightly so that unneeded
functionality was removed (mostly regarding timezone offset).
