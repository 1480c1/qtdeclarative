 - QTBUG-32838: Setting the model property of ListView, GridView or PathView to
   an empty model will now correctly reset currentIndex to -1. In prior versions
   currentIndex was set to 0 regardless of the actual number of rows in the model
   when the model property was changed after the view's initialization.
